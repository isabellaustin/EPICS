WFYI team project

This project was started and completed in Fall of 2022 by the following team:

Izzy Austin (Team Lead), Maddie Neely, Nick Donnelly, Erin Penner, Nic Reilly, Nolan Knight, Maddy Bloom

Our group used PowerBI, which is Microsoftâ€™s interactive data visualization tool, to design and implement a set of reports/dashboards, based on input from WFYI, to replace an old reporting tool that they were losing access to. First, we had to upload the data given to us by our client in a .csv file. Then, we had to spend some time carefully removing duplicate records and performing data validation to ensure the data being used in our reports is the same that was being used in their old reporting tool. Now, within the dashboards we created, our client is able to see the multi-year data in easy-to-use graphs and manipulate them to see the information over a specific time and date ranges as well as on specific days of the week, month, or even year.
